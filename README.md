# Raspberry Pi Pico Simon Says

## Overview
This is a small educational Python project designed to help me learn about **Embedded Systems**. 
The script plays the game [Simon Says](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Says) indefinitely, until the player makes a mistake. The player can choose
between 4 difficulties at the start of the game by pressing the buttons, red being the easiest and yellow the hardest, increasing the overall speed of the game.
